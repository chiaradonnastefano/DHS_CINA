# Problem
Cybercrime agents are continuously overwhelmed by the ever-growing demand for cybersecurity professionals, leading to an acute shortage of skilled personnel. According to recent estimates, there is a need for an additional 4 million cybersecurity positions worldwide to combat the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks [1]. In the U.S., the situation is particularly dire, with FBI personnel tasked with cybercrime cases outnumbered by a staggering 50 to 1 [2]. Furthermore, the distribution of personnel across various field offices is highly disproportionate, with each office allocated only 12 agents on average, which is insufficient given the breadth and complexity of cybercrime investigations [3].

# Goal
To address this critical imbalance, the goal is to determine the optimal allocation of cybersecurity personnel across states and field offices. By strategically redistributing resources, it is possible to better equip law enforcement agencies to handle the growing wave of cybercrime. This would involve analyzing the geographic distribution of cyber threats, workload demands at each office, and current personnel capabilities. With this data-driven approach, agencies can maximize their impact by deploying agents to regions with the highest need, ensuring that cybersecurity professionals are where they are most effective in combating this escalating threat.

# Key Insights
Our empirical analysis, with FBI field offices as a proxy, resulted in 2 important findings:
First, we found that cybercrimes are expected to increase in severity, specifically in densely populated and economically growing states, namely California , Texas, and Colorado (briefly discuss graphs). Consequently, agents in these field offices in these high-impacted states would face greater challenges in managing and processing the increasingly overwhelming number of cybercrime incidents. In other words, they may see longer processing times and reduced efficiency, which could further strain resources and hinder response efforts in these areas.

Second, having a static strategy of an equal number of cybercrime agents across all of the main field offices would not be the optimal strategy. Instead, maintaining a baseline number of agents across all offices while directing additional resources and personnel to the more heavily affected areas is advisable. 

By doing so should result in faster response times, enhanced cybercrime mitigation, and overall improvement in law enforcement preparedness and reduced employee burnout.

# Recommendations

In summary,  we identified an impending surge in severe cybercrime activities across all FBI field offices,this provides critical insights for strategic workforce planning.

We support informed policy decisions by demonstrating that high-impact field offices face disproportionate challenges in managing increasing volumes of compromised records. 
Therefore, we recommend a dynamic resource allocation strategy that maintains a baseline number of cybercrime agents across all field offices while prioritizing additional personnel and resources in heavily affected areas to optimize cybersecurity response effectiveness. 
This ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, with the capability thereby strengthening the overall capacity to detect, prevent, and manage cybercrimes effectively.

Furthermore, this recommendation would be in alignment with DHS strategic objectives to combat cybercrime activities.
To enhance the recommendation, incorporating employee data and skill sets would enable a more precise and tailored assignment of personnel to field offices.
Considering other spatial models may be helpful for improved accuracy with more data.
